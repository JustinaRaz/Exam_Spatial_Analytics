# Examining the Patterns of Foreign Migration to Denmark

## Short description

The repository was created to store the contents of the exam project for the *Spatial Analytics* (spring, 2024) course in *Aarhus University*. This repository contains code and other files that are required to reproduce the plots and results which are discussed in the project.

The main goal of this exam project was to explore immigration patterns to Denmark during the time period of 2020-2023. Spatial autocorrelation analysis - *Moran's I test with Monte Carlo Simulations* - was performed to investigate whether the total numbers of newcomers with the same country of origin tend to cluster across municipalities of Denmark.
